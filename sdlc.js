// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This step involves gathering and analyzing information about the software's purpose and intended users, as well as any constraints or limitations that must be considered in the design and development of the software."
const design = "This step involves creating a detailed plan for how the software will be built, specifying the structure, features, and functionality of the software."
const implementation = "This step involves the actual coding and development of the software according to the design plan, using programming languages and tools."
const testingAndIntegration = "This step involves testing the software to ensure that it functions as intended and meets the requirements defined in the previous steps, as well as integrating any additional components or systems that the software needs to interact with."
const maintain = "This step involves ongoing maintenance and support of the software, including bug fixes, updates, and improvements to the software over time."

// Note that while this is a general order for these steps. This is more like the Waterfall method while the agile method is becoming more popular.
